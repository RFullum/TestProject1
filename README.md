## Simple JUCE application that outputs pulsing saw wave sweeps.

This contains Oscillator classes used to create a saw wave, 
phasor, and "sparse" wave. 

The saw wave starts at 55Hz and the phasor sweeps it up 2 octaves.
The sparse wave controlls the gain, pulsing on/off.

I usually use this on a new system to ensure audio is being outputted,
after ensuring the default JUCE "Hello World" app compiles and runs. 
Extremely helpful to know if i've set up and installed JUCE and Code::Blocks
coreectly on a Raspberry Pi or VirtualBox.
